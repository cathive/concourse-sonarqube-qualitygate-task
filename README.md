# SonarQube quality gate checks for Concourse CI

This repository contains a task that can be used in conjunction with the [concourse-sonarqube-resource](https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource) to check if a quality gate has been met by the Sonar Analysis or not.

# Task usage

of your SonarQube quality gates have not been met.
